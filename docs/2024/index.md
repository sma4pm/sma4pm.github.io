## Scope

Streaming Process Mining is an emerging area in process mining that spans data mining (e.g. stream data mining; mining time series; evolving graph mining), process mining (e.g. process discovery; conformance checking; predictive analytics; efficient mining of big log data; online feature selection; online outlier detection; concept drift detection; online recommender systems for processes), scalable big data solutions for process mining and the general scope of online event mining. In addition to many other techniques that are all gaining interest and importance in industry and academia.

Recently, event streams are gaining attention in the process management and mining community not only for analytics but also for the management and orchestration of business processes. Examples are online event correlation as a preprocessing step for online process mining, using flexible rule-based event consumption and generation for enacting process instances, and decentralized process execution.

After a very successful three runs on this workshop together with ICPM 2020-ICPM 2022, this workshop aims at further promoting the use and the development of new techniques to support the analysis of streaming- based processes. We aim at bringing together practitioners and researchers from different communities, e.g. Process Mining, Stream Data Mining, Case Management, Business Process Management, Database Systems and Information Systems who share an interest in online analysis and optimization of business processes and process-aware information systems with time, storage or complexity restrictions. The workshop aims at discussing the current state of ongoing research and sharing practical experiences, exchanging ideas and setting up future research directions.

* Novel Algorithms for Stream-Based Process Discovery

### Guidelines

Authors are requested to prepare submissions according to the format of the [Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series by Springer](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0). Submissions must be in English. This year, we welcome submissions to the following two tracks:

1. **Main Track** with the number of pages should not exceed **12 pages** (including figures, bibliography and appendices). Submissions to this track should clearly establish the research contribution and the relation to previous research. Submitted papers to this track will be evaluated on the basis of significance, originality and technical quality. Accepted papers of this track will appear in ICPM workshop proceedings after addressing all audience and reviewers’ feedback.

2. **Work-in-Progress Track** with the number of pages should not exceed **8 pages** (including figures, bibliography and appendices). The aim of this track is to encourage researchers to share and receive feedback on ideas and/or proof of concept results of their promising ongoing research. All submissions to this track will be quickly reviewed by organizers and will be presented in a pitch + poster session on the workshop day. They will be published on the workshop website after addressing all audience and reviewers’ feedback.

Submission to both tracks should clearly emphasize the discussion aspects relevant to the workshop. Members of an international and solid program committee will review submissions.

Submitters are required to indicate if their data and software is publicly available and if so, where and if not, why not. Sharing both data and software is important for the development of the research area as a whole. We expect this low-impact demand will increase the visibility of our work and the availability of data and software to other researchers.





### Submission link

Papers and abstracts should be submitted through the Easy Chair web site in PDF format: <https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icpm2023>.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of them will register to the conference and present the paper. Registrations are managed by the ICPM 2023 registration system. Only papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be published in the conference proceedings.

## Proceedings

The proceedings of the workshops will be published together with the other ICPM workshops as conference proceedings by Springer-Verlag in its Lecture Notes in Business Information Systems (LNBIP) series.

However, the entire program, including the co-located events, will be retained, and will not change. With the spirit of keeping the entire conference as interactive as possible, presentations will be given live using webinars. The presentations will also be broadcasted, and also available after the conference for off-line viewing. Attendees will be able to ask questions, which will be answered at the end of the each presentation.

This is the abstract of his keynote:</p> <p>Abstract of: Adaptive Machine Learning for Data Streams</p> <p>Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to fundamentally shift the way we interact with our surroundings. The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as one of the most exciting and key opportunities for both academia and industry. Advanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases. Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in stream mining. In this talk, I will present an overview of data stream mining, and I will introduce some popular open source tools for data stream mining.</p> <p> Albert Bifet is Professor at University of Waikato, and Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Previously he worked at Huawei Noah\u2019s Ark Lab in Hong Kong, Yahoo Labs in Barcelona, and UPC BarcelonaTech. He is the co-author of a book on Machine Learning from Data Streams published at MIT Press. He is one of the leaders of MOA, scikit-multiflow and Apache SAMOA software environments for implementing algorithms and running experiments for online learning from evolving data streams. He was serving as Co-Chair of the Industrial track of IEEE MDM 2016, ECML PKDD 2015, and as Co-Chair of KDD BigMine (2012-2019), and ACM SAC Data Streams Track (2012-2019).</p>"},{"location":"2021/","title":"Streaming Analytics for Process Mining - 2021","text":"<p>Streaming Analytics for Process Mining</p> <p>To be held in conjunction with ICPM 2021.

Complex event recognition supports the abstraction of event data to conduct process mining; it enriches the expressiveness of process models in terms of the specification of events that steer process execution; and it enables monitoring of processes or even their enactment. Information on processes, in turn, is valuable to optimize the evaluation of queries for complex event recognition. In this talk, I review scenarios and respective solutions for the integration of complex event recognition and process management, and point to open research questions in the area.</p> <p> Matthias Weidlich is a full professor at the Department of Computer Science at Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin (HU Berlin), Germany, where he holds the Chair on Databases and Information Systems. Before joining HU Berlin, he held positions at Imperial College London and at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam.  His research focuses on the analysis of process-oriented systems, event stream processing, and exploratory data analysis. Matthias is a Junior-Fellow of the German Informatics Society (GI) and in 2016 received the Berlin Young Researcher Award.
